The Escort: An inhabitant of the Void Sea with bioluminescence and a short time flight ability. Despite the fate brought upon you, you seek out those who have come to the end of their journey.

Hey, Softie here. 

The intro sequence just has this playing because hee hoo Rain World https://youtu.be/yhDBeBWCbo0. Enjoy your glorified petting zoo which is basically what this is. Eventually, the site that I'll make for my ghosts that I'll eventually make will have some funny visuals. Probably a Carrd or a Google Doc unless I can be taught how to make Github sites.

The Void Sea Escort is currently in PRIVATE BETA (2.0!), which means something might break if I have not tested it enough. Which it very well might! Because it always does when it's out of my paws. I have no idea if the triggers work correctly. One way to find out!

If you have any suggestions as to what the narration should say or talk about please tell me but you're basically Schr√∂dinger's Slugcat interacting with a possesive mute with like three braincells to their name so it's bound to get boring eventually.
