The Escort: An inhabitant of the Void Sea with bioluminescence and a short time flight ability. Despite the fate brought upon you, you seek out those who have come to the end of their journey.

The intro sequence just has this playing because hee hoo Rain World https://youtu.be/yhDBeBWCbo0. Enjoy your glorified petting zoo which is basically what this is.

Something might break if I have not tested it enough. Which it very well might! Because it always does when it's out of my paws. The triggers probably work properly, but... sometimes you kinda can't fix it.

If you have any suggestions as to what the narration should say or talk about please tell me but you're basically Schr√∂dinger's Slugcat interacting with a possesive mute with like three braincells to their name so it's bound to get boring eventually.
